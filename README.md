# Adversarial-Representation-Learning-for-Medical-Imaging

## Brief Description
---
The goal of this work is to investigate unsupervised representation learning methods in the context of medical imaging, with the goal of learning representations useful for the end task of lesion and tumor segmentation.

Deep learning [1, 2] is at the core of recent advances in computer vision. Usually large labeled datasets are used for training in a supervised setting. However, such datasets are not always available. One way to cope with this challenge is to learn representations without labels, and finetune the model for a final task using the labels available [3].

This project will focus on the powerful framework of adversarial learning for learning representations at multiple scales in the medical imaging domain [4, 5].
